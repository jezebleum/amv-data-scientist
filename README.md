# Case Application Data Scientist AMV

You receive two files:
- cardata.csv: A CSV file containing 10000 cars with an id (AUTO_ID) and its characteristics
- behavior.json: A JSON file containing 106966 cars ids with a two additional columns containing the number of pageviews and contactrequests

Your assignment is to predict interactions (pageviews and contactrequests) based on car characteristics. 

The way you get to the results is more important than the results itself.
